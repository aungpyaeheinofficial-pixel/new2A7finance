CENTRAL BANK OF MYANMAR (CBM) GUIDELINES 2024

1. Foreign Exchange Policy
The Central Bank of Myanmar has updated the reference exchange rate determination method. Exporters are required to convert 35% of their export earnings into Myanmar Kyat (MMK) at the official CBM reference rate within one working day of receipt. The remaining 65% can be used for trade-related payments or sold at market rates to authorized dealers.

2. Mobile Banking Transaction Limits
To ensure financial stability and curb illegal digital currency flows, transaction limits for mobile banking platforms (e.g., KBZPay, Wave Money, CB Pay) have been revised.
- Level 1 Accounts: Daily limit 500,000 MMK.
- Level 2 Accounts: Daily limit 2,000,000 MMK (requires full KYC including biometric verification).

3. Gold Market Regulations
The Yangon Gold Entrepreneurs Association (YGEA) sets the daily reference price. However, market volatility often sees trading occur at a premium. The CBM urges gold shops to transact digitally to create a paper trail and reduce tax evasion.

4. Import Licensing
Priority import licenses are currently granted for:
- Pharmaceuticals
- Fuel and Energy products
- Agricultural fertilizers
- Edible palm oil
Luxury goods imports remain suspended until further notice.

5. Inflation Data
Year-on-year inflation for the fiscal year ending 2024 is projected to hover between 15-20%, driven largely by transport costs and imported commodity prices.
